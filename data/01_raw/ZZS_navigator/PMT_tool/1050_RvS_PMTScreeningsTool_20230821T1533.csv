625-45-6	Methoxyacetic acid	0.27	Low to moderate	The PMT-score is based on an aggregation of the P, M and T-scores using the following formula: PMT-score = (P-score)^0.33 × (M-score)^0.33 × (T-score)^0.33.	0.03	Low to moderate	This P-score is based on an aquatic environmental half-life of 7.7 days estimated using the BIOWIN3 model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.83	Very High	This M-score is based on the chemical’s organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) of -0.3 estimated using the KocWIN model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.81	Very High	This T-score is based on alerts for the following human health related endpoints: carcinogenicity (c), mutagenicity (m), reprotoxicity (r) and endocrine disruption. Also, structural similarity to known cmr chemicals, classification of the chemical into one of the three Cramer classes and whether the chemical is a carbamate or an organophosphate is taken into account.
62-55-5	Thioacetamide	0.38	High	The PMT-score is based on an aggregation of the P, M and T-scores using the following formula: PMT-score = (P-score)^0.33 × (M-score)^0.33 × (T-score)^0.33.	0.08	Low to moderate	This P-score is based on an aquatic environmental half-life of 14.5 days estimated using the BIOWIN3 model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.95	Very High	This M-score is based on the chemical’s organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) of -2.4 estimated using the KocWIN model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.72	Very High	This T-score is based on alerts for the following human health related endpoints: carcinogenicity (c), mutagenicity (m), reprotoxicity (r) and endocrine disruption. Also, structural similarity to known cmr chemicals, classification of the chemical into one of the three Cramer classes and whether the chemical is a carbamate or an organophosphate is taken into account.
62-75-9	N-Nitrosodimethylamine	0.52	Very High	The PMT-score is based on an aggregation of the P, M and T-scores using the following formula: PMT-score = (P-score)^0.33 × (M-score)^0.33 × (T-score)^0.33.	0.24	Low to moderate	This P-score is based on an aquatic environmental half-life of 30.6 days estimated using the BIOWIN3 model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.73	Very High	This M-score is based on the chemical’s organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) of 0.6 estimated using the KocWIN model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.80	Very High	This T-score is based on alerts for the following human health related endpoints: carcinogenicity (c), mutagenicity (m), reprotoxicity (r) and endocrine disruption. Also, structural similarity to known cmr chemicals, classification of the chemical into one of the three Cramer classes and whether the chemical is a carbamate or an organophosphate is taken into account.
64-67-5	Diethyl sulfate	0.41	High	The PMT-score is based on an aggregation of the P, M and T-scores using the following formula: PMT-score = (P-score)^0.33 × (M-score)^0.33 × (T-score)^0.33.	0.14	Low to moderate	This P-score is based on an aquatic environmental half-life of 20.4 days estimated using the BIOWIN3 model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.55	Very High	This M-score is based on the chemical’s organic carbon/water partition coefficient (Koc) of 1.7 estimated using the KocWIN model of EPISuite™ version 4.1.	0.92	Very High	This T-score is based on alerts for the following human health related endpoints: carcinogenicity (c), mutagenicity (m), reprotoxicity (r) and endocrine disruption. Also, structural similarity to known cmr chemicals, classification of the chemical into one of the three Cramer classes and whether the chemical is a carbamate or an organophosphate is taken into account.
